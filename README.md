# Data Structures and Algorithms
### *If you are planning to learn Data Structures and Algorithms using Java, this is the repository for you!*

## Prerequisites:
* Basic knowledge of Java.
* An IDE.

Go to "Faraz" and you will find the source code of different Data Structures and Algorithms with detailed documentation in the form of comments throughout the code.
 

If you are an absoulute beginner you can refer to the lectures by [Kunal Kushwaha](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9gnSGHSqcnr_DxHsP7AW9ftq0AtAyYqJ)
and [Apna College](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfqMhTWNBTe3LtFWcvwpqTkUSlB32kJop).

Please keep in mind that the lectures by Apna College are not good enough for interviews, they can only help you in getting familiar with the syntax
and a shallow discussion on the topics of Data Structures and Algorithms.
If you want to prepare for interviews, you need to study Data Structures and Algorithms in depth and Kunal Kushwaha is my recommendation for the same.

I also maintain a repository called "[LeetCode](https://github.com/farazxsiddiqui/LeetCode)" where I document my progress on LeetCode,
you can refer this repository for some good questions that are recommended by seniors and online tutors.
These can help you crack FAANGM interviews too.

## About
In this repository you can find well documented source codes for different Data Structures and Algorithms,
the documentation might be very helpful for you if you are a beginner.

## Pull Requests
* These source codes and documentations are written by me and it is possible that they might contain some errors.
* If you find any errors or if you think that there is a better way to explain that concept, please create a pull request.

## Thank you!
